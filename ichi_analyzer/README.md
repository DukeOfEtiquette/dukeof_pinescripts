# ICHI ANALYZER

Goal: Draw a line around the Price Low (PL) that visualizes how many bars are left at that PL, and what the next PL will be.

Assumptions: No new lows.


Goal: Using volatility within average date range, predict next X ticks and how it may impact tenkan, kijun, and lead span B.

Purpose: Early detector for potential Cloud signals (TK crosses, kumo twists, etc.)

- If price does not break recent PH or PL, then line stays flat
- If price breaks PH, then line will move up during that tick and potential even more next tick if PL increases
- Same as above, but inverse for price moving below recent PL


Goal: Draw lines at levels around line in to indicate a spread of potential entry/exit levels


Goal: Draw line/bars/whatever showing change of delta between price and tenkan/kijun/etc

Purpose: Show how far over extended we might be
