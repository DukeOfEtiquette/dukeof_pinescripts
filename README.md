# Duke Of Pine Scripts

All my pine scripts, but with source control.
No doubt these are out of sync with my local editor, c'est la vie.


## TODO

Build an indicator to...

- Measure bar body and both wicks
- Detect if a body crossed a line
- Detect if only wick crossed line
- Determine if WF SL is triggered
- Determine if price "bounced" on a line in either direction
- Determine strength of trend based on angle of MA
